# Speed Up API Integration: A Step-by-Step Guide to Refit and Microsoft HTTP Resilience for .NET Developers

Welcome to the **Refit and Microsoft HTTP Resilience** repository! This repo serves as a companion to the blog post, *
*[Speed Up API Integration: A Step-by-Step Guide to Refit and Microsoft HTTP Resilience for .NET Developers](<insert-blog-link-here>)
**, where we explore how to streamline API integration and make your .NET applications more resilient.

## About This Repository

This repository is designed to provide a hands-on walk-through of the concepts covered in the blog. You’ll find examples
demonstrating:

- **Setting up Refit** for clean, declarative API calls.
- **Implementing Microsoft HTTP Resilience** (using Polly under the hood) to handle transient errors and improve API
  call reliability.
- **Combining Refit and Polly** to make resilient, maintainable API clients.
- **Logging requests and responses** to enhance debugging and monitoring.

Each section in the repo is structured to help you understand how to configure and optimize your API calls in .NET using
Refit and Microsoft’s HTTP Resilience features.
